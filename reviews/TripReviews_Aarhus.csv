Tjeneren var √¶rlig og sagde at 8 retter var rigelig for de fleste og 10 retter mest var for de rigtig sultne. Vi var to, der begge fik 8 retter og 3 gode glas vine. Jeg n√•ede i ventetiden p√• min g√¶st at f√• en gin tonic. Den var stor men havde for lidt gin til min smag. Der var to glas hvidvine og et glas r√∏dvin til maden. Den ene hvidvin og r√∏dvinen var fine mens den ene hvidvin ikke passede til mad. Der blev dog fyldt godt op i glassene og en enkelt gang fyldt lidt ekstra. Normalt vil 3 glas vin ikke v√¶re nok til 8 retter + snack, men det var det faktisk. Ud af de 8 retter var der blot 2, der var lidt tamme.

We loved the decor and location, too.

Syv Ni 13,emili748,"July 20, 2020","Visiting this new restaurant was the highlight of a recent three day stay in Aarhus

I‚Äôll come back to the food and wine later. First my impression of the restaurant and the service.

The interior was somewhat minimalistic, however it has been designed well, which gave an elegant and pleasant atmosphere.

The staff clearly cared for the restaurant and it showed in a high level of service. Everything happened with a smile and my girlfriend and I could simply lean back and enjoy the evening. 

The primary wine card consisted of a selection of wine by the glass. The selection was not large, but I concluded this was bold given they succeded with the selection. The selection had alternatives both in taste and price, where we tried different glasses for a combined 8 different wines between me and my girlfriend. We were impressed by the quality. I often find wine served by the glass overpriced compared to their quality,  we found the opposite to be the case. We were very pleased with the wine and the waiter helped pairing it to the food.

The food were simply outstanding. Flavours and textures were done so well. The dishes are innovative and fresh and is an experience by themselves. 

Our only regret for the evening were that we did not try everything on the menu. We have to come back instead.

Recommended for couples and small groups that enjoy good food with a modern twist. The prices are fair. A dinner for two with us leaving more than full and well provided in wine came with a price of 1200 DKK. We indulged our selves, and a normal full dinner with wine could be done at probably 900 DKK (EUR 120) for two persons with full satisfaction.",5,Aarhus

Oplevelsen var dog ikke tilfredsstillende, prim√¶rt pga betjeningen. For det f√∏rste ville pigen i d√∏ren ikke godtage vores officielle coronapas app, uden at vi skulle vise siden med personlige oplysninger, selvom det udtrykkeligt st√•r i appen, at man ikke m√• vise den side til andre. Uheldig start, hvor jeg praktisk taget m√•tte uddanne d√∏rpigen i hvordan man afl√¶ser appen.. N√• men vi fik dog vores bord og bestilt ""bobler og snacks"", √∏vrige drikkevarer og hovedretter.. Der gik evigheder (nok 30 minutter) inden vi overhovedet fik noget at drikke, danskvand og bobler m. snacks. Vi havde s√• regnet med at vi kunne n√• at sidde og nyde boblerne m. mandler og oliven lidt, men kun 1 minut efter kom hovedretterne, s√• vi ikke havde tid til at nyde hverken bobler eller snacks uden at hovedretten blev kold, s√• vi m√•tte g√• direkte i kast med den og nyde boblerne med snacks til en for for inbetween og dessert. Min kone havde bestil laksesalat m. avocado som ekstra, og jeg havde bestilt ""hangover burger"" med jalapenos som ekstra. Det havde s√• √•benbart lykkedes betjeningen at f√• byttet rundt p√• dem p√• sedlen til k√∏kkenet, s√•ledes at jeg fik avocado i burgeren, og min kone fik jalapenos i sin salat. Jeg p√•pegede naturligvis dette over for serveringen, som erkendte fejlen, men i stedet for at tage retterne tilbage i k√∏kkenet fik vi blot tilbudt at f√• lidt ekstra avocado og jalapenos HELT GRATIS, og m√•tte s√• selv d√∏je med at fiske de fejlagtige ingredienser ud af vores retter og selv ombytte dem.

Restaurant Kowloon,658ullab,16. oktober 2021,"Kowloon er en grisk restaurant, der hellere vil tr√¶kke penge ud af kunderne end at yde god service.

Ift. nr. 72 s√• havde Kowloon valgt at bruge en klam klump oksek√∏d, der kun bestod af sener, hvilket gjorde retten komplet uspiselig og kvalmende. Jeg fors√∏gte en enkelt gang at ringe til restauranten samme aften, men uden held. Jeg t√¶nkte, at jeg ville g√• der op in person, hvilket jeg gjorde idag, l√∏rdag - jeg kunne ikke ig√•r fredag.

Hvordan skal jeg som kunde vide, at en ""Stor coca cola"" (50 cl) koster 30 kr., n√•r jeres fysiske menukort viste 20 kr. for en ""Stor coca cola"" og derudover angiver I ogs√• p√• jeres hjemmeside, at prisen er 20 kr. for en ""Stor coca cola"" (Se delte billeder).

Jeg pr√∏vede at v√¶re fair i min f√∏rste anmeldelse og havde reelt √©n ting mere at n√¶vne, men undlod dette, da jeg synes det var en mindre bagatel. Men nu synes jeg ikke det skal tilbageholdes.

Det vil v√¶re rart som kunde at blive informeret om, at i ikke har flere store colaer, i stedet for at f√• serveret en lille, n√•r man alligevel betaler for den store.

M√¶rkelig m√•de at g√∏re det p√•, t√¶nkte vi. Da vi kom frem til adressen s√• vi n√•et overrasket hvorfor. Det var mere et almindeligt pizzaria end en restaurant.

After giving us the whole spiel about how perfectly this wine will go with the meal, he pours us wine from a bottle that must have been open for days, practically vinegar. When our food arrives (accompanied by another spiel from the chef) you almost need a microscope to find it on the plate. What little there was was nice, but if not for the bread and butter I'd have left the restaurant starving. Not what you expect from such an expensive place, and yet another example of the pretentiousness that seems to have overtaken Danish cuisine in recent years.",1,Aarhus

(You know that moment when you have to tell everyone to shut up and just close your eyes to fully let your taste buds absorb these wonderful unusual flavors)
The atmosphere was lovely (bright, white danish feeling), the service lovely and the food beyond expectations. 
It is a bit more expensive but I believe definitely worth its money.",5,Aarhus

Turns out S'vinbar is exactly that place.
Located in the heart of Aarhus C right next to the monastery, it seems like the locals are flocking to this bar at 1.45 PM on a Wednesday almost as much as 9PM on a Friday - and I can understand why.

The wine menu is incredible, and whatever your preferences you will find your new favourite wine here - from the sweetest of Riesling's to delicious orange wines from Georgia and Slovenia.
Relaxed atmosphere, dimmed lighting, options to enjoy your drinks both inside on the beautiful wooden furniture or outside in the sunshine. Both very pleasant and knowledgeable staff and sommeliers, who are not shy of telling customers the story behind the wines and their unique qualities. All wines are also possible to buy 'take away' - to surprisingly affordable prices.

The food was nice without being unsurpassed. My cacio e pepe was a bit dry. Personally, I still prefer both AmoRomA and especially Prezzemolo when it comes to Italian in Aarhus but Piccolo is certainly a welcome addition to the Italian food scene in Aarhus.

P√• trods af denne ‚Äúsparede‚Äù aff√¶re med anvendelse af prim√¶rt de billigste ingredienser, kostede en lille salat n√¶sten 70 kr. og det var endda uden br√∏d eller noget til. Den ‚Äúsmoothie‚Äù jeg pr√∏vede skulle n√¶sten ikke engang m√• blive kaldt smoothie bowl, da den var s√• tynd, at det f√∏ltes som at spise juice med mysli.

Romantically this is great for couples. Small but cosy restaurant, candlit tables, wine and bubbles adlibitum and good friendly service. 
As a group experience, the coordination of the evening was excellent with good communication.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Fantastic cosy cellar with candlit tables laid out rustic style.

Hvis de laver s√• noget v√¶lg at ikke acceptere fritagelse s√• skal man vide p√• forh√•nd og forsl√• masken i stedet for at v√¶re uh√∏fligt. Jeg anbefalde restauranten ikke.

We have ordered meze plate but what the sausage and curry is doing in the Turkish meze plate? They charge way too much for a tiny bit of meze which is ridiculous. The plate has nothing to do with Turkish cuisine but definitely something for someone who knows nothing about Turkish cuisine. 

We also ordered Sultan Grill, the meat was hard to chew. 

On top of that the service was very slow, we had to catch the waiter each time when we need something. Bu the way the restaurant wasn‚Äôt even full. 

For us, it was a waste of time and money; we were so disappointed again about a Turkish restaurant. I would definitely advise the owner to go to Turkey to see how the real meze plate and grill is. It is easy to sell people who almost know nothing about the Turkish cuisine I guess. 

I definitely lost my hope on finding a proper Turkish restaurant in Denmark cos the owners have no clue about it but only caring for making money!",1,Aarhus

We ordered the set food menu with set wine and beer menu. Beer menu was very special and all the beer was well-suited to the food. We got quite tipsy towards the end of the evening though.

But after having eaten at the restaurant once, we've decided to only get take-away from now on. When we arrived, they first had to clean a table for us and that service really only included the table-not the chairs. He clearly saw the crumbs on the bench but instead of swiping them off, he just put some cushions on top... Problem solved. According to their menu, lunch pizzas cost 5kr extra if you eat in. However, the menu card does not list those lunch options. You have to look them up online on your phone and then pick them up at the counter yourself. At least that's what we were told until another lady at the table next to ours ordered a lunch pizza. To our surprise, she was told that it's actually not possible to eat a lunch pizza at the restaurant. But the owner would make an exception - just for her and just that one time (uhm.. not what the homepage says - or what we were told).

Bernth & Co,I9208USmarch,"November 19, 2021","This place has a cool concept of serving small dishes. It has a good ambience, nice unpretentious service and some exciting dishes, but they were inconsistent, from really good to mediocre. The Broccoli and Caviar dish seemed to have virtually no caviar or roe in it. Oysters with Soya, Ginger and Spring Onion - salt with salt - brave and beautifully presented, but not a taste hit. The Carpaccio was really good, but lemon juice would help. The Cod was good - vegetables a bit oily. Beef and Cabbage - excellent. Duck Confit was totally dominated by cucumber flavours.  Short ribs - one of my favourite cuts of meat - well spiced but a bit dry - sauce would help. The tiramisu was unworthy of the name - half a can of whipped cream, not enough coffee, lady fingers too dry. I can‚Äôt help but like and admire what they are doing though. It‚Äôs a really social and pleasant way to dine - it‚Äôs own thing and not simply tapas. Well done. Refine your menu slightly and this would be a hit.",4,Aarhus

Bernth & Co,xixit,"March 22, 2015","Well, Bernth is rather hard to review actually, cause it all depends on the sandwich you buy.

First of, the place is nice and clean, the personel is friendly, and everything is freshly made, so I won't complain about the quality.

However, the sandwiches ... are a mixed bunch.
The chicken is quite good.
The vegetarian and tuna's barely edible.
The banh mi is excellent!
And the italian meatball tastes like gall, utterly horrible.

Besides all that, the place is really expensive, so I cannot recommend it to anyone wanting a simple cheap sandwich.

All in all, I go there for the banh mi and the service, but it's way too expensive to do it regularly.",2,Aarhus

Unfortunately, I could not understand why I did not order it. When I had the terrine, It was obvious... I should have ordered the red wine!!!

But... the dessert. I really didn't like it. I had no choice between a cheese plate and danish style rice porridge with the cherry sorbet. I ordered the rice porridge dish. It was enough to clean your mouth but nothing more. It would be better to serve a smaller portion to just clean mouth.

 Everytime you go there it just seems that nobody cares to serve you or actually greet you. Every time you come in and you have to ring that bell and see those ""don't give a thing"" faces. Worst part is to call them and order it through the phone. First time I called them it was the girl which could not speak even single word in english, so she was asking others to answer it for her and in the end she just hang up on me, because nobody could answer for her (I hear other voices speaking besides her tho). 2nd time, I called them again and again this unsatisfied voice which simply replies"" yes, yes, no no"" and you don't even finish your sentence they hand up on you. Such a bad experience every time.

Luna Rossa,ullamille,18. august 2020,"Tror ikke nogen fra Italien har kokkereret i k√∏kkenet - en pastaret p√• en italiensk restaurant kommer ikke fra en micro ovn, som den pastaret med kylling og rejer min mand fik. En kedelig smagsl√∏s ret der ikke levede op til forklaringen i menukortet hvad ang√•r smag - den lovede smag af chili og hvidl√∏g udeblev, og i stedet en smag af tynd ukrydret tomatsovs. N√•r man t√¶nker p√• prisen for en pastaret s√• burde det kunne g√∏res bedre. Men det v√¶rste er at tjeneren slet ikke kan tackle d√•rlig kritik af maden - hun sp√∏rger i et v√¶k om hvad g√¶sterne synes om maden - men tilsyneladende s√• forventer hun kun at vi roser maden til skyerne. Deres bruschetta smagte fint men bar pr√¶g af at det de bruger er fra glas og d√•se ud over de friske tomater.

It is really an outstanding experience to see preparation of sushi rolls, maki, nigiri and many more in live and just front of you.
My favorite was the soft-shell crab sushi with its extraordinary crispiness and excellent flavor. 
They also offers a great and toothsome nigiri type, when nigiri being torched for a second and it gives a nice twist to raw texture of salmon or tuna etc. 
Both, the chef in the show kitchen and attendance service are very amicable while you are waiting for your order and having a cold Japanese beer.

However, this time, arriving in Aarhus at about 7 p.m., I discovered the restaurant was closed. I wasn't in the mood for searching for another good restaurant and decided to have dinner at the hotel (Comwell Aarhus). 

Normally, you don't expect much of a hotel restaurant - at least, not in Denmark. owever, this one was quite a gem.

You can choose between three starters, three main courses and three desserts. 
The restaurant has wine recommendations for all courses - and if you prefer another wine, the waiter will give you very professional advice. By the way, the selection of wine by glass is impressive.

Bone's Restaurant (Tilst),alexsvanholm,"August 9, 2018","This is more of a general review as I've been at this restaurant many times now. Bone's have restaurants everywhere in Denmark, and they're very popular. Not for the prices (because it is a little expensive), but because of the restaurants' setting, environment and food. They're always running campaigns. For example, if two people go to a Bone's restaurant on either a Monday or Thursday, and one of those two have a student card, they get cheapest main dish for free! It's an amazing deal, because you could save 200 kroner! Their spareribs might be the highlight of what they could offer, but their burgers, salad bars and softice bars are quite amazing as well. The only reason why I'm not giving them 5 stars instead of 4 is due to the waiting time. Sometimes it can take them two minutes to deliver your food (which is impressive), however sometimes you can sit and wait for up to half an hour. Definitely try out Bone's! I have - not just once or twice, but maybe a hundred times. You won't get better spareribs anywhere else in Denmark!",4,Aarhus

In regards to the wine menu, we were positively surprised, because the waiter kept coming and refilling our glasses. Very good service!

The waiter on the night was very busy, but manged to give good service anyway. But the waiters don't have a deep understanding for the food or wine, therefore it was nice that the chefs came out and presented the food every time.

The food is too oily, overcooked and under seasoned. The many different rice options were utterly indistinguishable and awful. Bland and embarrassing. The different curries were generic. They consisted of overcooked vegetables with chewy, boiled meat and chicken in amongst a sticky sauce. This is not Indian cuisine! We hoped to taste fresh hummus, tabouleh and baba Ganoush. Only hummus was served at Zafran and it was also a disappointment. Unless this restaurant starts taking itself more seriously I am afraid it will not survive long.

Resturant Pinden,Anita O,"December 30, 2016","The reservation is via email, and it took some time for it to be confirmed. On arrival 4 people had arrived and ordered drinks. I enquired about the wine, and only offered house wine as per glass. I was given a generous taster but when confirmed I would take the wine, the glass was 'topped up' rather than provided with another glass. 
We waited for some time to order, but it went with no issues -also provided English menu.
The popular meal is 'stegt flask med persille sovs"" which means pork belly with white parsley sauce served with boiled potatoes. You can choose between 6 pieces for Kr 99 or Ad Libitum for ¬£149. 5 persons chose the 6-piece option. One person chose ""biksemad"" which is a kind of roasted potatoes and 'left- over' pork roast heated in a frying pan served with two fried eggs. A substantial meal also.
On serving the meal, we were not given individual servings but a general serving of each item which we had to pass along the table as you would at home. It might be cosy but not restaurant service to be expected when you buy a meal with 'a number of meats slices per person. 
Also, when I cut into my piece of meat, a log hair was curled underneath. This may have been from one of the fellow guests, but again, the restaurant chooses to service a meal which is passed along and thus, their responsibility that my meal ends up on my plate without contamination.
I kindly asked the waiter to replace my plate, which was done. I received no apology or offer of replacement which meant I only had 3 small slices left of my meal. Also you better ensure sharing with persons who don't take it all...
The food was tasty but I had had better versions of the pork belly as it was 'very done' and to dry to eat without the sauce. The parsley (loved like dry parsley rather than fresh) was just put on top for yourself to stir into the sauce.
The waiter dropped the spoon for the potatoes but did not automatically replace it, and I had to ask for a new one, as the persons started to use their own forks.
Also, after the food had been put on the table, they did not say it was all there for us to commence so it was standing there for 5 minutes getting cold until we realised that it was all there to be passed around.
We sat there for 2 hours, and not once asked if we needed any drinks or dessert. 
We asked for the bill which was put on the table, but had to be paid at the bar due to credit cards.",3,Aarhus

Sorry to say, but that is not how you handle something like this. On top of that, the service was VERY slow. We paid full price and were not offered any compensation for our complaint - and of course, no replacement of my main dish.

Restaurant Vinde,Mik_Jens,"June 10, 2019","Was here 2 years ago almost on the date. Went again with my girlfriend. We were pretty curious to see if Vinde could meet their former standard, after the horrible beating they have been taking in the August 2018 reviews both on here and facebook. Since last time I was here the sushi stand has quadrupled in size, and for good reason. It is extremely popular, fresh and well made. Pieces are small in size, so don't get a set sushi menu. On the upside the pieces are way easier to eat. 

I must stress this is a buffet restaurant primarily, so this is where you get the gold. Apparently they had a birthday offer, so they had reduced their price to 118 DKK from 148 DKK (weekend price) - an even bigger bargin. Other people had noticed this, and around 18.00 the restaurant was at full capacity. Still the service was nice and attentive, and the buffet reasonably stocked up at all times. 

It should also be noted that this is a popular place for families, and there's even a playroom for the kids. So expect some noise.  

All in all we had a nice evening here, and the food was good. Especially considering the price. We mainly ate sushi and added veggies from the salad stand. But if you want, you can go the complete opposite direction with all sorts of deep fried things, and standard Chinese buffet type dishes. 

My rating is given within the context of being a buffet-style / cheap restaurant.",4,Aarhus
Restaurant Vinde,Mik_Jens,"June 13, 2017","Was here with my girlfriend to conclude a days outing. We were looking for something solid and not too expensive, and having contemplated going to Vinde before we decided this was the day. 

This is mainly a buffet restaurant and one of the better ones in Aarhus. Compared to for example China Palace which has the same concept (and dishes pretty much) Vinde was just a touch better on most points. And the price is a little bit lower to boot. The choice of sushi was more extended and the ice cream bar has 10 different flavors of scoop ice (CP has one flavor soft ice). Also the decor and service was just a tad nicer.

At these Chinese buffet / Mongolian Barbecue places you should make sure not to miss out on the barbecue part. I personally prefer this over the actual buffet, which I only use for sides. 

If you arrive by car there 3 hours of free parking just in front of the restaurant. If you park right at the door, make sure to get a free parking voucher from the staff.

There is sushi + traditional buffet + salat bar + mongolian bbq + self-take ice cream with toppings. Free tea/coffee is included with the buffet. Moreover, the restaurant is located away from the city center which implies that there is always free parking, space to sit and some privacy. We have been there several times and evem tried their menu, but I would suggest that buffet gives more for the price and you can always find the food you like among the selection.",4,Aarhus

The service was also friendly and effective, even though they were moderately busy at the time.
Foodwise my favorites are the sushi and the Mongolian barbecue, which has a good selection of meats and veggies. Bear in mind though, that the sushi consists of a variety of nigiri, and maki/uramaki, and is not too diversified.

The servers were not rude at all, more like not properly trained and like they were both working their first shifts. Taking our order and delivering the drinks took way to long. That being said, the sushi was fantastic. Everybody absolutely loved it. 
We tried all of the dessert. We agreed that Creme brulee is defiantly not their strong suit. The other dessert were fine.
The atmosphere was lacking, don't know if it was lack of music or something else but they definitely work that out.
You get the feeling that this place is run by a great sushi chef that may not have that much experience with service or hospitality.

So, it's a buffet that includes salads and hot dishes, veggie and meaty. The fixed price also seems to include unlimited wine or beer. The food was simply delicious.

What you have to be ready for is that there is a communal feel to the place, but it's a very friendly and informal feel. Be ready for a limited choice of drinks too - there is a single white wine, one choice of red wine and one type of beer.

My main request for improvement would be some fruit option(s) for dessert. But that wouldn't stop me going back, time after time.",5,Aarhus

On the food side there was ox, chicken, smoked salmon, fish cakes, falafel, different salads, bread, some vegetables. All of it was quite high quality and very tasty. I was a little disappointed by the dessert options which was a soft ice machine with different toppings and a crumble. I would have liked at least one other choice on that part. But oh well. Service was friendly and helpful even though you do most of the things yourself, like bringing away your dirty plates. The place is very pretty but quite noisy.

But recently they changed staff and the waitress there are extremely unfriendly and unprofessional. I went there with my boyfriend and his mother after we been bragging about the extreme good quality of food. However, as we arrived 2 minutes early we were basically told off. It would have been fine if they asked us to just wait a couple of minutes and our table will be ready. However, we were frowned upon and reminded about our time and that we should go stand to the side until it‚Äôs time. Personally I thought that was embarrassing. Nonetheless we clicked the service button a while ago and they took extremely long time to get us. Even though I could see that they obviously were doing nothing.

I suspect it is largely a place for lunch, coffee or snacks, but it is a wonderful, economical place for dinner on the Wednesday evenings when the museum is open until 10 PM.  Then, in addition to their regular menu, a special is offered (currently pork with asparagus and potatoes, with a glass of wine or beer, for only 160 kr.)  It was delicious.  Separately, the museum is relatively quiet on Wednesday evenings; dinner at the ART Caf√© is a wonderful way to break up an evening enjoying the exhibits.",4,Aarhus

Kiin Kiin,LykkeEK,"September 26, 2020","I went with some colleagues - in total seven.

We had made reservation and on recommendations preordered the food in order to avoid waiting.

We didn‚Äôt arrive together.
I arrived with one colleague as the first and we were asked if the group wanted sparkling and/or still water. Failing to mention the price for sparkling water (we both thought it was included especially after we got three bottles of each).
When one arrived they barely god to say hi before the waiter came and asked what they would like to drink and seemed impatient when they were told that one needed to look at the menu first.

All the starters was excellent and so was the main that arrived at the table in an okay pace. 
But the startet to clear the plates in the pace we finished - that‚Äôs not how it should be done. All the plates at ones.
It resulted in one colleague being the only one with a plate on the table.

We asked to hold of on the dessert and was told that it wasn‚Äôt a problem and we should just let them know.

One ordered a drink.
Then two others ordered drinks.
The last two drinks arrived but we had to ask for the first drink that they failed to deliver.

Then the dessert arrived - without us asking for it.
The dessert was delicious but we would have liked to wait a bit longer.

After the dessert one ordered a beer.
Before she got it we were presented with the bill being told we had to leave since they needed the table.

Go for the food it absolutely scrumptious.
The service leaves a bad impression and the staff is clearly untrained and that takes a lot away from the experience.
They should have;
- informed us about the price for the water 
- informed us about about the fact that we had a timeframe 
And then the overall vibe that the serving staff showed was poor.
I think we were presented with 6-7 different serving staff, none of them seemed to know what they were doing.

What was there tasted very nice, but this isn‚Äôt a City restaurant with a Michelin star! We know Denmark is expensive when coming from the UK, but this sunk to a new low point of price versus substance.

Refills of coffee great once replaced with something that was hot, and our waitress kept trying to be helpful and apologising for things.

As suggested in neon on front of one one of the balconies, you can trust in the crust - it was very good, as were the toppings piled on.

Then we ordered single pizza‚Äôs and drinks. 
I think it took 10 minutes from the first had something to drink and to the last one got his.. that‚Äôs too long.  But of course one wineglass was dropped at the table by the waiter and she brought a wrong beer, that took extra time. And I think our redwine was 5 degrees.. that‚Äôs to cold. 

The pizza was good, I mixed with some collegues. And all tasted good. We did ask if the meat balls was beef, which the waiter said yes... but it looked and tasted like pig, so we asked ind the kitchen, and the confirmed... that‚Äôs not ok...

Finally they came and told us that we had to leave, because there was coming a party! When we booked they didn‚Äôt tells us that we only got the table for 1,5 hour. So no cocktails there.

Kal√∏vig Badehotel,ileanacezarat,"October 17, 2018","We went here the first time with a SpotDeal for a 3 dish menu. To be said that if this was a deal to bring people here and made them return it failed completely. The hotel is located in a nice, quiet area but the restaurant room is very cold, lacking coziness or any decoration of that matter. The staff was nice and welcoming, although extremely busy since there were only two waiters for a rather big room. We waited long before getting served or being taken the empty plates from the table. I stress again that waiters were very nice but due to being so busy it took long for them to service. 
The food was an entire difference story. We had a soup as a starter. Although advertised as having shrimps those were completely missing from the plate and the soup were very, very salty. For a person enjoying a bit more salt than the average, I found it still very salty. Had a considerable amount of oil in and also some butter in the middle of the soup. Both me and my boyfriend felt that our stomachs didn‚Äôt tolerate the dish immediately after we have eaten it, or what we have eaten out of it. 
The second dish was steak-fries with bernaise sauce and salad. Steak came alone on a white simple plate without any decoration or anything to make it more appealing. Fries came separately in a bowl for both of us and again, very salty. The steal has been cooked as required and meat on an average quality. But the fact that the food has no visual appeal made it feel like there was put absolutely no effort to make the experience pleasant. The salad was hardly called a salad. There were literally salad leaves and some nuts on top. No dressing, no mixing. That is not really a salad. The picture which advertised the menu was picturing a delicious, mic salad combining more ingredients than two. The entire 2nd meal had a very appealing picture for serving idea, but reality didn‚Äôt match it even close.
As a desert we had an old day apple cake which was tasty and we enjoyed, and a cheese plate. The choice of cheese was nice but we had no side to that, no grapes or gems or anything that would work with a cheese plate, but some bread. 

Overall a very disappointing experience, that ended us a bad stomach and wasted money. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone. Hopefully this is the way the Spotdeals are served and not the entire regular menu.",1,Aarhus

Although we agreed to come back in about 30 minutes as he wanted us to, we felt very bad at his terrible arrogant behaviour and after a walk around of 15 minutes, we went back and politely told him that we have changed our plans, and may come again some other time.

Both the soup and the Green Beef Curry were totally salty and not Thai at all. When we complained the explanation was, this is a fusion of Thai and Danish food. I think, thats an insult of both kitchen. The young lady had no idea of Thai food and only offered to add some water to the precooked soup. What a disgrace!
Never again! The chef should attend some cooking classes urgently to learn the basics.

Da vi placerer os ved bordet g√•r der lang tid f√∏r der kommer nogen for at tage imod vores ordre og fordi min kone var g√•et i forvejen, er tjeneren ogs√• i tvivl om vi overhovedet er blevet placeret ved bordet af nogen. Vi har p√• det her tidspunkt parkeret en barnevogn med vores 3 uger gamle barn, mellem vores bord og nabobordet, hvor den st√•r, da vi f√•r udleveret menukort og taler med tjeneren. Da g√¶sterne ved bordet ved siden af kort tid efter ankommer, sp√∏rger vi om vi skal rykke barnevognen. De andre g√¶ster er venlige og siger at den gerne m√• st√• der, men deres tjener forklarer nu at man slet ikke m√• have en barnevogn p√• restauranten, hvorefter han g√•r, uden at uddybe n√¶rmere. Derfor ender jeg med at forlade restauranten, mens resten af selskabet kan blive tilbage og spise, simpelthen fordi det var det eneste sted der var et bord. Jeg synes det er fair hvis man har lavet en regel om ikke at ville have barnevogne, men jeg synes det er meget d√•rlig kommunikation at man ikke fort√¶lle sine g√¶ster dette meget hurtigt efter ankomst. At det s√• ogs√•, for mig, virker som en s√¶r prioritering, ikke at ville have barnevogne p√• en restaurant der ellers er s√• familieminded og i √∏vrigt ligger p√• sin egen etage, er noget andet.

The desert is usually some brownie etc. One thing I can assure you is that you will be full after you are done with the buffet!

Dalle Valle,Livelife80,"May 28, 2017","After a Saturday night out with a little hangover sunday. 
We weren't prepared to cook sunday evening. So my cousin asked us to join them for a buffet. We said yes of course, and as I am sitting here writing this I still regret visiting that place. 
The ambient was nice the waiters did what they supposed to do, remove old plates so there were space for another and bring bevareges. 
But it all ends there. 
They started with a commercial saying all of May eat for 49kr but when we came we could see that there were a new price 59kr. Normally this buffet kost 119kr the price on the menu card.
So cheap yes, but don't scare your customers away after one visit. 
I must say though they have a lot of different kind of food and salat.
The food was bland and dull, it did not taste of anything, the meat dryer then the Sahara dessert and the dishes was more salty then the dead sea. Everything tasted prefabricated, and yes it was cheap so what can we expect? at least a little more decent food.
I ordered a beverage they called a frozen mango, oh my ... it was terrible sweeter then sugar, with a synthetic taste of mango. I had to top it up with water several times and even with ekstra water i was still sweet.
The dessert from the buffet was fruit and fruit is what fruit is, but they had a little glass fill with some ""chocolate"" mousse, tasted more lige coco powder you mix up with milk.
We could't even read what kind of meat you put on your dish, because there were no signs of anything. 
So do I dare to visit that place again. Let me put it like this. A bowl of instance noodles is more delicious.",1,Aarhus

Carl's Jr,glagnar,"September 16, 2018","The burger was the usual fast food burger, better than McD - BUT. The service was terrible. My wife received a burger and discovered a piece of blue plastic glove encased inside her burger. Of course we were revolted, and the only thing the offered was a replacement burger. I was expecting an apology, and we were given none. We filled in a review card and gave it to the management via the postbox, no-one has contacted us since. 
The company obviously has no interest in neither a quality product or having happy customers. I am dissapointed.

Carl's Jr,Suresh R,"March 28, 2018","With such a wide variety of burger places in the town, this one in the big mall - Stor Center Nord - near the university has its attraction for students and other residents. Although the place, the staff, the outlook, the ambience are all nice, the food experience is just average. The burger claims to be using pure Angus beef, but it is full of chia seeds filling out for the real meat - but it is OK, and tasty. The worst part is the soggy, soggy and more soggy bread/bun on top and bottom of the burger - even Macdonald and BurgerKing can have better bread - and that will be a miracle if they ever had better; but it fells as if they have the better one than Car's - who must do something about it urgently and even more urgently - now.",3,Aarhus
Carl's Jr,Mik_Jens,"June 18, 2017","Considering you can get an organic, free-range, sustainable burger at Burger Shack that tastes way better for 10 kroner less for the equivalent bacon/cheese burger that I got here, it does not make any sense to waste your time and money on this place.

Considering there is a literal burger war going on in Aarhus with a wide variety of high quality burger bars popping all over the city it makes even less sense.  
Looking at the meal it self it's only a small step up from the garbage, you get at McDonald's. Looking at the price it's even more expensive than the high quality burgers there is on offer around town.

Cafe Hollywood,Inli,"October 31, 2016","Cafe Hollywood in √Örhus has 2times in the last few moths offered a sweet deal brunch for 59dk that is supposedly worth 100dk! We unfortunately bought 4 of these deals! At the time of the first visit we are asked to present our sweet deal and shown to a table, no menu card is offered only a drink card, fair enough we have basically already ordered! However on the second visit there was 3 of us and we had only 2 sweet deals so we needed a menu card, which we got, the 3 person also orders a brunch however his brunch cost 89 dk and is the only brunch on the menu to our surprise! To our greater surprise when the 3 brunches arrive the two that should be worth 100dk contain much less than the brunch for 89 dk. We of course contact our waitress who claims she is new and will send a manager over! He does not come so we go to him. He comes over and very condescendingly tried to explain that the Sweet deal brunch has the same content, he checks the plates and can see that this is not the case! He then tells us that they are changing their menu next week and their brunch will be 100dk!! This does not explain why a 89dk brunch is being sold as a 100dk brunch with a 41% savings! Not to mention the reduction of the portion! This is completely false advertising and misleading to the customer! The management was rude with regards to the situation going so far as to say that if we were not satisfied with our purchase we just should not come back!! Seriously! This is not what I call customer service! First you cheat your customers then you are rude to them! Needless to say we will not be going back to this place!",1,Aarhus

If you ask for a medium steak you get a raw, ask for a bloody steak, you get below medium.. the salat bar is bland, and boring..

I am a vegetarian but my family loves a good beef, normally I cook at home, so there's never a big fat beef. We went in because I thought, I would do something for my family, and sacrifice myself a little. The thing is... 1: they have ONE! ONE?! vegetarian dish. So I thought well whatever I'll take it, and so I did, but I am lactose intolerant and there was this butter in it, so I ask for it without it, but NO... that is not possible... WTF! Then she's like ""well we can make the salad-bar to a main-course instead and I'm like ""whatever I guess, I don't really have a choice"". I go down there and It's so sad. I could make a better salad at home + there's only small bowls. But it's whatever, I eat a little with some fries I got with my salad (that btw ended up costing 100kr!) When that's over my family ordered dessert, but they have absolutely nothing without lactose, so I just sit and look while the rest of my family enjoys their delicious (looking) desserts. + they were out of foods/dishes and my father got the wrong fries... whatever.
