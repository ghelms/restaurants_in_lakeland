Mumm,Bubziz,3. december 2021,"Waow... Sikke en dejlig fornøjelse at besøge Mumm. Vi bestilte 6 retter, valgt af kokken og med en halv vinmenu til. Vi kom godt omkring i de 6 retter. Og fik noget for enhver smag. Halvdelen af vinene var fra lokale vinproducenter og til sidste blev vi ført rundt i Italien via vine ",5,Roskilde
Mumm,MichaelSejerHansen,14. august 2021,"Super hyggelig restaurant ned kompetent professionel betjening. Maden veltillavet måske til den lidt fade side. Fra Lille Frit fald menuen faldt især retten røget kammusling og desserten med figenolie baseret is i vores smag.

Mumm,Mini J,13. juni 2020,"Vi bestilte Frit Fald til 1.265,- pr. person og fik fantastisk mad med spændende vine til. Det undrede os dog at vi kom til at betale kr. 110,- for vand oven i menuernes pris, i en helaftens-menu som denne burde vand være inkluderet! Menuen bestod i overvejende grad af fisk og grønt - hvilket vi syntes var lækkert. Er man til kød skal man måske vælge noget andet - eneste ret med kød indeholdt et meget lille stykke fjerkræ. Indretningen er moderniseret siden vi var på restauranten sidst - og det er lige til den kedelige side. Pænt, men meget anonymt.

Et særligt vinkort kommer på bordet, og en ikke særlig dyr rødvin bliver anbefalet. Forretten er tapas af pølse, skinke og ost. Hovedretten er kalvekød med diverse helt utroligt velsmagende tilbehør. Der er pænt travlt med en del ud af huset, bl. a. 12 pizzaer, men der er tid til os også. Dejligt måltid med en grappa at gå hjem på.
