Mumm,Bubziz,3. december 2021,"Waow... Sikke en dejlig fornøjelse at besøge Mumm. Vi bestilte 6 retter, valgt af kokken og med en halv vinmenu til. Vi kom godt omkring i de 6 retter. Og fik noget for enhver smag. Halvdelen af vinene var fra lokale vinproducenter og til sidste blev vi ført rundt i Italien via vine ",5,Roskilde

Mumm,Mini J,13. juni 2020,"Vi bestilte Frit Fald til 1.265,- pr. person og fik fantastisk mad med spændende vine til. Det undrede os dog at vi kom til at betale kr. 110,- for vand oven i menuernes pris, i en helaftens-menu som denne burde vand være inkluderet! Menuen bestod i overvejende grad af fisk og grønt - hvilket vi syntes var lækkert. Er man til kød skal man måske vælge noget andet - eneste ret med kød indeholdt et meget lille stykke fjerkræ. Indretningen er moderniseret siden vi var på restauranten sidst - og det er lige til den kedelige side. Pænt, men meget anonymt.

Et særligt vinkort kommer på bordet, og en ikke særlig dyr rødvin bliver anbefalet. Forretten er tapas af pølse, skinke og ost. Hovedretten er kalvekød med diverse helt utroligt velsmagende tilbehør. Der er pænt travlt med en del ud af huset, bl. a. 12 pizzaer, men der er tid til os også. Dejligt måltid med en grappa at gå hjem på.

We were able to enjoy a nice outdoor table and our food came out rather quickly. All the restaurants in Denmark seem to be quite expensive (but also trendy) compared to US prices but for $75 we were able to get two adult meals, one beer and one kids meal. 

My salmon was not a flavor I particularly liked - I prefer a lemon based salmon to a sweet one - but it was still tastefully prepared and presented. They use a lot of seeds in Denmark and my salmon was no exception, being topped with seeds and the sides with seeds also. My husband loved his burger and my 2 year old ate quite a bit of his meatballs. Overall a nice dinner and one my husband still talks about.",5,Roskilde

King Running Sushi og Wok,BrianHammer71,21. februar 2019,"Running sushi har ikke altid det bedste ry, men dette sted er bedre end gennemsnittet. Deres sushi er på højde på andre sushi steder i byen synes jeg. Vores besøg startede ellers lidt kaotisk. selvom vi have bestilt bord, så endte vi med at få det allersidste bord på båndet. Det vil sige at alt mad skulle forbi 25 andre borde før det kom forbi vores, og derfor var der naturligvis ikke meget tilbage på båndet til den tid. Vi overvejede at gå igen og luftede vores utilfredshed med placeringen. Det endte med at ejeren kom forbi og tilbød os det første bord, bare på den anden side, da de netop ville åbne op for deres andet bånd. Det sagde vi naturligvis ja tak til og derefter blev det bare en perfekt oplevelse. Glimrende sushi, masser af variation og frisklavet. Det er den populære amerikaniserede version med mayo, inside out og ebi crunch. Men også mere klassisk nigiri med laks eller tun. Kan desværre ikke sige så meget om de kinesiske lune retter da jeg kun var der for sushien. Det eneste minus er at prisen lige har fået et nøk opad. nu er det 188,- på hverdage. Men kvaliteten er også klart bedre end mange andre running sushi steder. så det er vel ok, især hvis man har en god appetit.",4,Roskilde

Vi betalte endda for chilimayo, selvom vi havde betalt 269 kr for at få all you can eat, selvom man ikke selv kunne vælge.

Det var ikke tilfældet, i stedet var det kun en type sushi -forskellige slags ruller, men ingen variation i form af forskellige slags sushi. Skuffende!

Det kan også godt gå lidt stærkt for pigerne når jeg bestiller takeout via deres app, jeg er et par gange kommet hjem med maden og så har der manglet et eller andet, så jeg har lært på den hårde måde at tjekke det hele inden jeg går ud af døren.

Here everything was just appalling. Waiter lost our order, brought wrong food and finally when we got there food it didn’t have anything to do with Indian food.",1,Roskilde
Namaste Roskilde,Anubhav J,"September 1, 2020","We were 8 people for dinner and got to share:
-  4 starters...not to oily or large quantities, seekh kebab was sizzling nice, 
- 11 main dishes (all with rice)... ranging from sweet and buttery to extreme hot spicy
- 6 naans...potato, cheese, garlic they have it all, 
- 2 raitas (very well prepared and fresh)
- 3 gulab jamuns (2 per plate) with ice cream and warmed - the proper way to eat
- lassis and waters
all for about 250 DKK per person (With 3 chutneys and saunf) >> AND EVERYONE TRIED EVERYTHING AND ENJOYED WHOLEHEARTEDLY!! (Chilli is Fun!!)",4,Roskilde
Namaste Roskilde,lenemike,"June 6, 2020","On previous occasions we've picked up take away curries and had dinner at the Namaste, so our third visit was for lunch. An on the spot decision, encouraged by an announcement of special lunch offers and by the re-opening of restaurants in DK after a couple of months of covid-19 closure. The curries served were very good, veggies for her and lamb for him. The lunch deal includes a beer or a soft drink, so very good value. No doubt we'll be back when in town again.",4,Roskilde
Namaste Roskilde,LiseS956,"February 14, 2020","Nothing exciting to say about the place. Typical Indian food, ok and ordinary. You would expect it to be cheaper, but it’s not! Definitely not a place to revisit. Waiters act like they couldn’t care less. 
A bottle of tap water 0,5 l is 25 kr (aprox. 3€), the cost of 1 liter of water for the restaurant is aprox. 40 øre which equals a profit of more than 10000 %. I guess that’s the punishment for not choosing one of their expensive drinks.",2,Roskilde
Namaste Roskilde,559ianw,"January 15, 2020","I ate here tonight with a colleague,  it's a good job we went early as it was packed on a Wednesday evening. The food was delicious..I had the sheek kebab to start and it came on a sizzling platter ..it was beautifully spiced and presented. I had the hot and spicy chicken as main, it was delicious with a rounded spice that didn't overpower the flavour of the chicken and sauce.
For an added touch of theatre, the hand towels we were given after the meal were rehydrated with warm water from a teapot!
Even the men's bathroom smelt nice with quality handwashing toiletries. 
I also discovered they deliver! They will be getting a lot of my business in the future I highly recommend this place.",5,Roskilde
Namaste Roskilde,SamvitNeilMenon,"January 12, 2020","As our trip to Denmark was winding to a close, a few colleagues suggested an Indian dinner to sign off and this is where we ended up. There were four of us and that allowed to explore quite a variety of stuff from mutton roghan josh to chicken tikka masala, veg pulao, paneer saagwala, and mango lassis. Well, the drunkard that I am, I had a cocktail, and I must say, I was incredibly impressed by the food and the cocktail! I'm a hardcore foodie and a critic and, given the circumstances, the food did well to please me! The meat wasn't merely boiled and dunked into the gravy, it was well marinated and tender. The gravy had the right amounts of spice - not too spicy and not spiceless! If I had to pick one criticism, it would be the use of excess food colour, but yeah, I'm still not complaining. 

Anyone in Roskilde or Copenhagen looking for decent Indian food, I'd strongly recommend this place.",4,Roskilde
Namaste Roskilde,GWRfanabroad,"December 7, 2019","No secret that Indian restaurants in Denmark often disappoint. This one meets UK curry expectations though it may not be straight out of Bradford or Leeds. The curries seem to come with rice included which is, I think, adapted to the Danish clientele. Everything is good, modern, professional, sleek even and the staff is lovely. The curries veer towards mildness so I'd say go for a notch spicier than you normally would. Naan breads were good and the pilau rice excellent. Sizzlers very pro. Very good lamb and acceptable chicken. Mango lassi did not disappoint. Fully licensed so no need to go without the usual Kingfisher or Cobra.
Price bracket higher than the neighbouring Indians but seating and atmosphere more opulent.",4,Roskilde

Det var en smuk aften så vi tog på en udvalgt en flaske Pino Noir , bestilte to tærter og sad udenfor og se folk kommer hjem på deres aften besværligt. Vinen var god, og pizza ankom hurtigt. Der var en mexicansk Pizza (Aztec). Chorizo-pølse, rød sauce og Jalepeno peber. Den pizza havde en dejlig sprøde tynde lag (de har deep dish på menuen). Saucen var ret god standard man og meget godt i forhold til danske normer (italiensk er normale ikke en nordisk specielle) Pænt sure og fuld velfungerende. Peber og chorizo gav det en dejlig krydret sparke. Den anden Pizza var en grøn peber og pepperroni. Igen et dejligt tynde lag, masser af hvidløg og en god sauce. De tilbyder andre typer af mad (burgere, wraps .... ) og som så godt at komme ud af køkken ",4,Roskilde

De er super smarte da bægrene til isen er super store og toppings er store stykker slik. Dvs at det er først når man når hen til betalingen at man opdager hvor dyr dyr dyr den is er. To is til børnene uden toppings andet end krymmel og jordbærsauce til 100 kroner..... Det er simpelthen tyveri. Ja det er vores egen skyld at vi bliver fanget i det og vi trækker heller ikke nogen stjerner fra på den konto men tyveri, det er det. Den varme chokolade var kraftig og god men alt for lille mens latte´n fåes bedre andre steder i centret. så en regning på 184 kroner for to is og to gange varme drikke med langsom betjening og siddepladser med masser af larm.

The Spot Cafe,L5786MHcarlp,"September 5, 2021","Hi.

I always look for places where the heart rules and it shows in the food quality and the attitude of those who work there. In Roskilde it is extremely hard to find a good place to eat, i have been far and wide, but i think i found one of the gems here. 

I hesitantly decided to try out a burger here as they have frozen yoghurt, for kids. Which to me shouts ""baby and mouthbreather trap"".  I walked in, read the description and was fairly impressed, and i tried it and wow, i was amazed by how the quality was shining from it, but i am not sure if it is true. It is a feeling and they do say it is organic. Thr bun is wholemeal and tasty which i always call for anywhere i go. And even the cheddar seemed real. The vegetarian steak tastes almost like meat aøevrn in consistency and it tastes amazing. 

If you had provided a detailed, easy to read ingredients list in respect for we who come and eat your food, i would have given you 5 stars.

Those who work there seems calm and friendly, and it feels like the restaurabt is actually owned by one participating in it actively and also in the food making. Perhaps that is why i almost shed a tear of happiness looking at it and taking a bite.

Fantastic place, sadly i cannot go there tonight to get dinner. It seems like they close waaay too early, but im happy they care for their own life and let us have it as a treat instead of overworking themselves feeding us;p

Thanks, i will be back, tomorrow. And i will get two;p",4,Roskilde

In Roskilde, we tried a couple of muffins and we ordered a chicken-salad with mango-curry sandwich. Unfortunately, all of their sandwiches have rocket salad in them, and I can't eat rocket salad. They apologized several times for the inconvenience and, after I asked, they agreed to make me a sandwich with the chicken and the sauce but without the rocket salad. That was nice of them, but I think they should have offered instead of me asking, since it is part of the company's policy.",4,Roskilde

Rejerne, som blev serveret uden mayonnaise, var af den billigste slags, man køber i store catering spande og kunne muligvis nydes, hvis de havde været puttet i en tartelet.

Da vi ville bestille noget at drikke var første besked, at der kun var én slags øl og kun nogle få typer sodavand. Dernæst kom beskeden så, at der ville være ca. 30 min. ventetid på maden ""fordi vi har en konfirmation ovenpå"". Maden var da den kom på bordet, pænt sagt ikke imponerende, dog ok. Det er en Italiensk restaurant og min pizza var tykbundet og meget ""brødagtig"". De unge mennesker som serverer er søde, dog uden den fornødne professionalisme som f.eks. da en taber et brød på gulvet ved udskæringsbordet samler en anden det op og det blev skåret op og lagt i kurv. Da protesterede jeg ganske enkelt højlydt og så blev kurven båret ud i køkkenet og måske kasseret. Min oplevelse af dette besøg er ganske enkelt, at den/dem som ejer restauranten ikke var til stede eller også er ligeglad med niveauet, det er i hvert fald så dårlig og manglende ledelse så for vores vedkommende er det sidste gang vi har været der selvom vi bor lige ved siden af stedet.
