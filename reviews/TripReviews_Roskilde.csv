Mumm,Bubziz,3. december 2021,"Waow... Sikke en dejlig fornøjelse at besøge Mumm. Vi bestilte 6 retter, valgt af kokken og med en halv vinmenu til. Vi kom godt omkring i de 6 retter. Og fik noget for enhver smag. Halvdelen af vinene var fra lokale vinproducenter og til sidste blev vi ført rundt i Italien via vine ",5,Roskilde
Mumm,MichaelSejerHansen,14. august 2021,"Super hyggelig restaurant ned kompetent professionel betjening. Maden veltillavet måske til den lidt fade side. Fra Lille Frit fald menuen faldt især retten røget kammusling og desserten med figenolie baseret is i vores smag.
Vi kommer helt sikkert igen.",4,Roskilde

Mumm,Frisenvang,10. august 2020,Spiste en udsøgt middag på Mumm. Vi valgte samtlige små retter på spisekortet og delte dem så vi kunne smage det hele. Alt var rigtig lækkert og tjeneren gav både en personlig betjening og var meget vidende omkring den mad der blev serveret. Dette må klart være den bedste restaurant i Roskilde.,5,Roskilde
Mumm,magnussanderb,7. august 2020,Så dejlig oplevelse på Mumm. Sad i gårdhaven og det er virkeligt hyggeligt! Billederne lyver ikke! Så behagelig betjening. Lydhør overfor lidt ændringer i retterne. Super lækker og ærlig mad. Dejligt med en menu hvor man begrænser sig til få men gode retter! Alle 4 var meget glade da vi gik fra Mumm! Vi ses helt sikkert igen,5,Roskilde
Mumm,Mini J,13. juni 2020,"Vi bestilte Frit Fald til 1.265,- pr. person og fik fantastisk mad med spændende vine til. Det undrede os dog at vi kom til at betale kr. 110,- for vand oven i menuernes pris, i en helaftens-menu som denne burde vand være inkluderet! Menuen bestod i overvejende grad af fisk og grønt - hvilket vi syntes var lækkert. Er man til kød skal man måske vælge noget andet - eneste ret med kød indeholdt et meget lille stykke fjerkræ. Indretningen er moderniseret siden vi var på restauranten sidst - og det er lige til den kedelige side. Pænt, men meget anonymt. God afstand mellem gæsterne og fin hygiejne i disse tider...",4,Roskilde

Og fik noget for enhver smag. Halvdelen af vinene var fra lokale vinproducenter og til sidste blev vi ført rundt i Italien via vine ",5,Roskilde

Mumm,Frisenvang,10. august 2020,Spiste en udsøgt middag på Mumm. Vi valgte samtlige små retter på spisekortet og delte dem så vi kunne smage det hele. Alt var rigtig lækkert og tjeneren gav både en personlig betjening og var meget vidende omkring den mad der blev serveret. Dette må klart være den bedste restaurant i Roskilde.,5,Roskilde
Mumm,magnussanderb,7. august 2020,Så dejlig oplevelse på Mumm. Sad i gårdhaven og det er virkeligt hyggeligt! Billederne lyver ikke! Så behagelig betjening. Lydhør overfor lidt ændringer i retterne. Super lækker og ærlig mad. Dejligt med en menu hvor man begrænser sig til få men gode retter! Alle 4 var meget glade da vi gik fra Mumm! Vi ses helt sikkert igen,5,Roskilde
Mumm,Mini J,13. juni 2020,"Vi bestilte Frit Fald til 1.265,- pr. person og fik fantastisk mad med spændende vine til. Det undrede os dog at vi kom til at betale kr. 110,- for vand oven i menuernes pris, i en helaftens-menu som denne burde vand være inkluderet! Menuen bestod i overvejende grad af fisk og grønt - hvilket vi syntes var lækkert. Er man til kød skal man måske vælge noget andet - eneste ret med kød indeholdt et meget lille stykke fjerkræ. Indretningen er moderniseret siden vi var på restauranten sidst - og det er lige til den kedelige side. Pænt, men meget anonymt.
